thank you for gaving me star, I`m building an object detection model, this .py file is only a part of my project. When I finish it and if it works good, I will release them.
Let us fight for object detection!

## shareWeightTridentBlock.py

This is a trident block that can share same weights with pytorch, 
according to Resnet Block modification,
if you want to bulid a TridentNet like paper [《Scale-Aware Trident Networks for Object Detection》](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.01892)
just build the number you want blocks like build resnet block

# news
I release my experiments code of trying to use tridentnet:multitrident(https://github.com/wei-yuma/multitrident/master)(I am updating). Thanks for your attention, I am just a student, I want to show my work and discuss my question about object detection with you. Just for fun!
I didn't use share weights trident block, bucause I found it's performance is not good, I think I made something wrong
